# LeanSig

A model of the hash-based signature scheme proposed by Ethereum Foundation. Optimized for being
a model for checking the correctness rather than optimized for exploration as the reference
implementation ([Hash-Based Signatures in Rust]).

Despite the name, actually, it's not an implementation of [LeanSig] proposal.
